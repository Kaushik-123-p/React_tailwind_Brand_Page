# React Vite + Tailwind CSS Single Page Project

This project is a simple single-page application (SPA) built using React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to demonstrate the setup and usage of these technologies together, featuring a minimal layout with an image.

## Features
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
